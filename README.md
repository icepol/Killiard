## Description

Killiard is a local multiplayer arena game made for Global Game Jam Slovakia 2025.

You play for two hamsters, Cricetus and Hamsterelian.  
Drunk people threw them on the billiard table to have fun.  
Like in the gladiator fight, the goal is to kill the second lovely cute hamster!  
Enjoy... muhahahaaaaa!
